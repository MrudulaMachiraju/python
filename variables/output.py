#The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
x = "Python"
print(x)


x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

'''x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)'''
#if u run the above code u will get an error
#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "rinku"
print(x, y)
