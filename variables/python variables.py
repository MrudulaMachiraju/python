#variables are containers for storing data values
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
x=5 #x is type of int
y="rinku" # y is type of string 
print(x)
